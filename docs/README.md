# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Project Management Processes (Overview)
OctoAcme runs projects using a structured, iterative lifecycle that moves work from idea to production with clear decision points and lightweight artifacts. Projects begin with Initiation (a Project One-pager to define the problem, goals, success metrics, and stakeholders), move into Planning (kickoff, prioritized backlog, estimates, acceptance criteria, and a Definition of Done), then Execution (development, testing, code reviews, and tracking), followed by Release (staging verification, smoke tests, automated deployments when possible, and rollback plans), and conclude with Close &amp; Retrospective to capture learnings and action items.

Workflows emphasize repeatable practices to reduce risk and increase predictability. Teams use a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and a pull request workflow that encourages small PRs, clear acceptance criteria and issue links, and CI checks before review. Releases follow a checklist-driven approach: pre-release verification, staging smoke tests, automated or scheduled deployments, post-deploy verifications, and documented rollback steps. Blocker escalation paths and incident playbooks ensure fast triage and clear ownership when issues arise.

Roles and communication are explicit to ensure accountability and alignment. Core personas include Project Managers (coordinate delivery, risks, and communications), Product Managers (define outcomes, prioritize work, and measure success), Developers (implement and test), QA/Testers (validate acceptance), and Stakeholders (provide approvals and context). The typical communication cadence includes daily standups for the delivery team, weekly PM–PdM syncs, end-of-sprint demos, and monthly stakeholder updates, with defined escalation routes for critical issues.

Quality assurance and continuous improvement are built into every stage. Automated unit, integration, and security scans run in CI, and smoke tests validate critical flows before releases; manual QA supplements automation where necessary. Risk is tracked in a simple risk register (ID, impact, likelihood, owner, mitigation) with weekly reviews. Retrospectives capture 2–3 prioritized action items that are tracked in the backlog to drive measurable process improvements.
