## How to use this matrix
- Identify the **Primary Owner** for each activity to clarify accountability.
- Engage **Contribute** roles early to gather input and avoid rework.
- Use **Support** and **Review** interactions to coordinate handoffs and approvals.
- Reference this matrix in project planning to ensure all necessary roles are included.
- See [Handoff Checklists](octoacme-handoff-checklists.md) for detailed artifacts and validation steps at key handoff points.
