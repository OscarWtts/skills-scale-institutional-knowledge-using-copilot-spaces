# OctoAcme Handoff Checklists

This document provides actionable checklists for key handoff points in the project lifecycle. Each checklist identifies required artifacts, validation steps, and approvers to ensure smooth transitions between phases.

## Design → Implementation Handoff

Use this checklist when transitioning from design to development.

### Required Artifacts
- [ ] **Design comps** (high-fidelity mockups) for all screens and states
- [ ] **Interactive prototype** (for complex flows or interactions)
- [ ] **Design specifications** (spacing, colors, typography, component usage)
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria** (clear, testable requirements linked to user stories)
- [ ] **User flows** (documenting key paths and edge cases)
- [ ] **Assets** (icons, images, fonts exported and accessible)

### Validation Steps
- [ ] **Accessibility review**: Color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support documented
- [ ] **Responsive design check**: Designs reviewed for key breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] **Dev feasibility review**: Developers confirm designs are technically feasible with reasonable effort
- [ ] **Design system alignment**: Components align with design system or exceptions documented
- [ ] **Localization considerations**: Text length variations and RTL layouts reviewed if applicable

### Reviewers & Approvals
- **UX Designer**: Signs off that design is complete and ready for implementation
- **Product Manager**: Confirms design meets product requirements and user needs
- **Tech Lead / Developer**: Confirms technical feasibility and estimates effort
- **QA**: Reviews acceptance criteria for testability

## Implementation → Release (DevOps/QA) Handoff

Use this checklist when transitioning from development to deployment and QA validation.

### Required Artifacts
- [ ] **Deployment runbook** (step-by-step deployment instructions, rollback plan)
- [ ] **Test results** (unit, integration, and end-to-end test reports)
- [ ] **Migration scripts** (database or configuration changes with rollback procedures)
- [ ] **Configuration changes** (environment variables, feature flags, secrets documented)
- [ ] **Monitoring and alerting** (new metrics, dashboards, alerts configured)
- [ ] **Release notes draft** (customer-facing changes, breaking changes, known issues)

### Validation Steps
- [ ] **Staging smoke tests**: Critical user flows validated in staging environment
- [ ] **Security scans passed**: Static analysis (SAST), dependency scanning, container scanning
- [ ] **Performance testing**: Load tests or performance benchmarks if applicable
- [ ] **Database migration dry run**: Migration tested in staging with rollback validated
- [ ] **Feature flag validation**: Feature flags tested in staging; rollout plan confirmed
- [ ] **Documentation updated**: Internal docs, API docs, and user-facing docs reflect changes

### Approvers
- **DevOps Engineer**: Confirms deployment readiness and infrastructure prepared
- **QA Lead**: Signs off on test coverage and acceptance criteria met
- **Security Lead**: Approves from security perspective (no critical vulnerabilities)
- **Product Manager**: Confirms feature ready for release

## Release → Customer Success/Support Handoff

Use this checklist when transitioning from release to customer-facing support and post-launch monitoring.

### Required Artifacts
- [ ] **Release notes** (customer-facing summary of new features, fixes, breaking changes)
- [ ] **Training materials** (videos, tutorials, or documentation for new features)
- [ ] **Support playbook** (common issues, troubleshooting steps, escalation paths)
- [ ] **Rollout plan** (phased rollout strategy, timeline, customer segments)
- [ ] **FAQ and known issues** (anticipated questions and documented workarounds)
- [ ] **Contact list** (engineering on-call, product owner, escalation contacts)

### Validation Steps
- [ ] **Support playbook reviewed**: Customer Success and Support teams trained on new features
- [ ] **Monitoring dashboards live**: Key metrics and alerts configured and validated
- [ ] **Rollback plan tested**: Rollback procedure validated in staging; on-call engineers briefed
- [ ] **Customer communications drafted**: Email, in-app notifications, or blog posts prepared
- [ ] **Incident response ready**: On-call rotation confirmed; escalation paths documented

### Approvers & Escalation Contacts
- **Customer Success Manager**: Confirms readiness to support customers
- **Product Manager**: Approves release communications and rollout plan
- **DevOps Engineer**: Confirms deployment and monitoring are operational
- **Engineering On-call**: Acknowledges readiness to respond to incidents
- **Escalation Path**: Project Manager → Product Lead → Engineering Director

## How to use these checklists
- **Reference in project planning**: Include relevant checklists in project timelines and kickoff documents.
- **Customize as needed**: Add or remove items based on project complexity and risk.
- **Track completion**: Use GitHub Issues, project boards, or checklists in PR descriptions to track handoff progress.
- **Learn and iterate**: Update checklists based on retrospective feedback and lessons learned.
